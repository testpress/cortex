# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains formal records of significant architectural choices made for the Cortex platform.

## Purpose

ADRs provide historical context and reasoning for decisions that impact the entire codebase. They ensure that future developers (human or AI) understand the "Why" behind the infrastructure, preventing accidental regressions or deviations from the core philosophy.

## ADR Index

- **0001**: Neutral UI Philosophy
- **0002**: SDK-First Monorepo Architecture
- **0003**: Accessibility Contract
- **0004**: Runtime DesignProvider

## Format

Each record follows a standardized structure:
- **Context**: The problem or requirement.
- **Decision**: The chosen technical direction.
- **Consequences**: Resulting benefits, tradeoffs, and side effects.
